Policy Mappings
(sails.config.policies)

Policies are simple functions which run **before** your controllers.
You can apply one or more policies to a given controller, or protect
its actions individually.

Any policy file (e.g. `api/policies/authenticated.js`) can be accessed
below by its filename, minus the extension, (e.g. "authenticated")

For more information on configuring policies, check out:
